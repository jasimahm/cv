          19 year old student passionate about becoming a full-stack
          developer solely through free online resources. I am currently
          enrolled in The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp course 
          created by Dr.Angela Yu that is published on udemy.com. I have
          already watched a few videos on HTML, CSS, and Javascript, 
          but this is the first full course I intend on going through 
          to learn full-stack development. I have given myself 3 months
          to familiarize myself with full-stack development and ready myself
          for a new career in tech and I am really excited about it. I'll 
          keep publishing on here with updates on how it's going! This page
          is also, in fact, my very first project for this course, so you'll
          get to see how I progress with said updates. Thank you for taking the 
          time to view my work :)

  into website folder, can also add all images into images folder but
  would need to create a path to file when linking image to src, ex:
